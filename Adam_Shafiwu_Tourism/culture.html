    <h2>1. The Damba <span style="color: gold;">festival</span></h2>
    <p>The Damba festival is the largest festival in Ghana, celebrated by the peoples of the Northern, Savanna, North East, Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana.In recent times, Damba has become a multinational festival, attracting visitors from all over the world. 
        The festival is annually celebrated in Germany, USA, and UK. </p>
<p>
The name Damba is in Dagbani. Other variations include Damma in Mampruli and Jingbenti in Waali. The festival is celebrated in the month of Damba, the third month of Dagomba calendar. The purpose of the festival is to celebrate the rich heritage, 
history and chieftaincy of Dagbon and related kingdoms. Dagbon is the birthplace of centralized kingdoms, chieftaincy and royalty in both Ghana and Burkina Faso. The month of Damba also corresponds to the third month of the Islamic calendar, Rabia al-Awwal.
Damba was first celebrated to mark the birth and naming of Muhammad, but the purpose of celebration has largely changed to glorify heritage and chieftaincy. Damba has also been adopted by the Gonjas of the Savanna region. The Gonjas have specific months in which they celebrate the festival. 
The festival is categorized into three sessions; the Somo Damba, the Naa Damba (King) and the Belkulsi (farewell procession).
</p>
<p>
ACTIVITIES: <br>
The festival starts with the announcement of the start of the month by the Yidan Moli, to the Yaa Naa. On the 11th day of the month, the “Somo” Damba starts, followed by the “Naa” (Kings) Damba on the 17th day. It is concluded with “bielkulsi”, which is the climax of the celebration, coming off on the 18th of the month of Damba. 
Within this period, prayers are offered to ancestors, drumming and dancing, families pay visits to friends and exchange gifts. The festival also includes Binchera Damba, where young people were worn out but fashionable smocks, and Shinkaafa Gahimbu (picking of rice)

       <h2>2. CHUGU  <span style="color: gold;">(FIRE FESTIVAL)</span></h2> <br>
        The Buɣim Chuɣu (Fire Festival) is the first Dagomba festival in the year. It is celebrated in the first month of the Dagomba lunar year, the Bugum Goli (the month of fire), and is celebrated on the ninth day of the month. The festival is celebrated to remember the "lost son of a king" during ancient Dagbon. </p> <br>
        
        <p>Traditional Origin Story
        The origin of the Bugum Festival dates back to the time when one king lost his dear son. The name of the king and the said son are no longer known. It is thought that the event took place before the unification of Dagbon by Naa Gbewaa. Naa Gbewaa and his descendants started chieftaincy in Dagbon, Gmamprugu, Nanung, Wala, Mossi, Bouna, etc. 
        The story has it that a child went out to play with his colleagues and as they played, he became tired and went and laid down under a tree. He soon fell asleep. The other children forgot of him and went home when they finished playing.
         In the evening, the parents (king and wife) did not see him. The king thought he was with the mother and the mother also thought the child was with the father. After supper that the mother called on the king to take the child to bed. It was at that moment that they found that the child was not with any of them. The king ordered his subjects to go round the neighborhood in search for the son. They did not find him. Even, the children he went out with could not remember.</p> <br>

        The king quickly assembled his warriors and told them what had transpired. 
        The warriors were instructed to look for the son. Because it was at night and dark, the people lit torches in search of him. Finally they found him under a tree deeply asleep. They sent him to his parents who were desperately waiting for his arrival. The parents thought that the tree stole the child and hid him. They therefore considered the tree an evil tree and threw the torches they were carrying on that tree and shamed it. The community at that time regarded that particular tree as an evil tree and many feared it.
         The king decreed that the event should be marked yearly to commemorate the event. Every year they assembled in front of the king's palace to celebrate the festival. When they set fire, the king or the chief used to be the first to lite the fire with his torch. The chief did not go far and dropped his torch and returned home. The people continued the practice and used to go to the evil tree and threw their torches on it. While marching to the evil tree, they played and danced ziem, a dance for the tindaamba 'land priests'. 
        The people used to and still dress as warriors when celebrating Bugum Chugu in Dagbon.</p>
