        <a href="https://molenationalpark.org/wildlife.php"><p> <h1  style="color:#2c3e50;"> Mole <span style="color: gold;"> National</span> Park </h1></p></a>
       <p> The Park has very rich flora and fauna. Over 93 species of mammals, about 300 species of birds, 9 amphibian, 33 reptilian and several insectivorous species, and 56 endemic butterfly species have been recorded, in particular:</p>

       <p> <b>i. Species of Conservation and Tourist Interest in Mole </b> <br>
Mole National Park has over 90 species of mammals.  Elephant, buffalo, kob, warthog, waterbuck, bushbuck, roan antelope, hartebeest, duikers, oribi, patas monkey and green (vervet) monkey are the species commonly seen at Mole National Park. Aerial surveys of the large mammals have been carried out between 1993 and 2006. Predators in the Park include spotted hyenas, leopards, caracal, civets, genets, jackals and mongooses. Even though there are lions in the park, their population and home range has declined, making their presence and sighting rare.</p>

<p> <b>ii. Endangered Species </b> <br>
The lions (pantheraleo) and elephants (laxodonta Africana) found in Mole National Park are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of 2004. The spotted hyena, buffalo, oribi, roan antelope, kob, duiker and reedbuck are listed as lower risk on the same publication. These species require particular management to thrive.

<p> <b> iii. Birds </b> <br>
Studies have been made of the avian life in Mole National Park, and a full report can be consulted (Dowsett, 2005). Over 300 bird species have been recorded, many of which are migratory birds heading to or from Northern Europe. The Carmine bee-eater and Saddle-billed stork are particularly stunning, and all will appreciate their beauty! <br>
Mole is unique in its bird populations: all 37 recorded Guinea-Sudanian biome species found in Ghana are here in the National Park. If you are a keen bird watcher, Mole is a must! As well as the species mentioned earlier, you are almost guaranteed sightings of martial eagles, the white-headed and palm-nut vultures, herons, egrets, the Abyssinian roller, the violet turaco and the red-throated bee-eater, to name a few.</p>

<p> <b>iv. Reptiles </b> <br>
There are 33 reptile species in the Park. The Nile crocodile, slender snouted crocodile and dwarf crocodile can be seen in the rivers within the Park.</p>

<p><b> v. Butterflies </b><br>
More than 50 butterfly species have been spotted in Mole National Park, including the Anthenetalboti, which is usually limited to East Africa. Mole is the only part of West Africa where this species has been recorded. <br>
The total butterfly fauna is probably about 120. Most are typical of the Guinea savannah belt. Two species of Euphaedra were found: the genus is mainly one of the understorey of true evergreen forest, but the two species in question seem well established in dense woodland in the park. <br>
The West African savannah habitats are generally not species rich, and there is virtually no endemism. True savannah butterflies constitute about 15% of the total Ghana butterfly fauna of more than 900 species. The best season for butterfly studies in Mole is between late May and early June. </p>

<p> <b> vi. Flora </b> <br>
The dominant vegetation of Mole National Park is open savanna woodland with grasses that can reach 3 metres high during the rainy season. Burning plays an integral part in the maintenance of this vegetation. Bovals are open areas of short grassland which are found on areas with shallow soils and iron pans. Narrow bands of riverine forest grow along most of the streams. Other plant communities, such as swamps and flood-plain grasslands, cover only small areas. Most of the 742 plant species found in Mole are widespread throughout the savanna zone. However, the species of conservation value (4 endemic, 12 disjunct and 24 species which are rare or have a very limited distribution) is relatively high. Their abundance is generally low and they are often confined to small areas. <br>
Since 1916, plants have been collected from within the present area of Mole National Park, with the bulk of the collection carried out during the Aberdeen University Expeditions and J. B. Hall's studies (Hall, 1976c). Hall published a provisional check-list (Hall, 1976c) containing 719 species and subspecies. An extended list including the authors' samplings (November/December 1992 and February/March 1993) has been compiled by Schmitt and Adu-Nsiah, 1993. It contains 739 species of vascular plants which include 148 tree, 61 shrub, 166 grass and 281 herb species, 75 climbers and 8 ferns.</p>

<p> <b>Species of Conservation Value at Mole National Park2 </b><br>
Local endemism is generally low in West African savannah, and only two endemic species are confined to northern Ghana: Kyllingaechinata, a sedge, and Aneilemasetiferum var. pallidiciliatum are found in Mole. In addition, three species which are endemic to Ghana were recorded, namely Gongronemaobscurum, Raphionacmevignei and Rhinopterysangustifolia. <br>
The 11 disjunct species of Mole are confined to savannah woodland, with the exception of Mimusops kummel, a tree found in riverine forests. Five species have been identified in Mole which have not been recorded elsewhere in Ghana: Croton pseudopulchellus, Indigoferaconferta, Indigoferatrichopoda, Jatrophaneriifolia and Pleiotaxisnewtonii. <br>
Anthocleistavogelii, a tree of wet sites in the south-western forest zone, was recorded for the first time in Mole. Apodostigmapallens is a climber which is normally also restricted to the forests in the south-west. Amblygonocarpusandogenesis, a savannah tree widespread in central, east and south tropical Africa, was recorded for the second time in Ghana.
Approximately 38% of the plants recorded in Mole are also found in the forest zone. 39% of them (or 15% of all Mole plants) were classified as 'non forest species' by Hawthorne and JuamMusah (1993). 461 or 62% of the plants found in Mole are savannah species.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaga_Slave_Market"><p> <h1  style=" padding: 10px;" > Salaga <span style="color: gold;">Slave Market</span> </h1></p></a>
    <p>
       <b> Salaga Slave Market </b> is an 18th-century slave market located in the East Gonja District of the Savannah Region of Ghana. <br> During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, Salaga served as an important market where slaves <br> were transported to the coast for export. The market also served as outposts for the movement of slaves along the trans-Saharan routes. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        From the 16th century, Salaga was one of leading market centers in West Africa. Salaga was founded by the Mande leader Dyakpa Nde wura in <br>16th century Gonja kingdom before being overrun by Asante forces in 1744. During the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1874, the British defeat of <br> the Asante ended the Asante rule over Salaga. However, this coupled with the British abolition of slavery in the Gold Coast in 1874 - 1875 did <br> not end the Salaga Slave market practices in the Gold Coast. <br> There were frequent caravans of slaves from Salaga to Kintampo slave market, then to southern or coastal areas, however it was abolished in 1896. <br> Kete-Krachi took over, <br> then slave caravans, some of which were ordered by the slave raider Babatu came there directly from Bole, Wa, Bonotuku and Upper Volta. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Kola, beads, ostrich feathers, animal hides, textiles and gold were among the goods traded in the market. However, in the 18th century, the <br>market became a key center in the trading of humans. People from the Upper west, Upper East and Northern Regions served as sources for slaves.<br> Slaves from the market were mostly exchanged for Kola nuts, cowries and gold. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the market, there were various stands for slaves, cattle, sheep, and merchandise. Slaves would be inspected and bargained for a price. A variety <br>of people benefited from slavery at the market as it became a commercial venture. For example, local chiefs benefited through the sale of slaves.<br>Although there was a sentiment that the practice was inhumane, it became a common feature of life in Salaga.
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding: 10px;"><span style="color: gold;">Features</span> Of Salaga</h2>
    <p>
        Slaves were kept in a warehouse with a mud roof during rainy days. In modern times, the roof is protected by an aluminium roof to protect from <br>unexpected weather changes. Wells located around the market are, according to oral tradition, associated with slave labour although the water <br>management system pre-dated the slave trade. There is also a stream that is often associated with the well said to have been the bathing place of <br>slaves, known as wanka bayu. Additionally, there were was a slave cemetery known as rafia angulu.
    </p>
    <h2 style="padding: 10px;">Salaga <span style="color: gold;">Today</span></h2>
    <p>
        In modern times, the Salaga Slave market was abandoned by the East Gonja District Assembly and the Ghana Tourism Authority. It had been <br>reduced to a parking space or used mainly for business activities. However, recently through initiatives such as the 2024 Emancipation Day <br>celebration, the Ghana Tourism Authority has decided to refurbish the slave market and the slave wells. This was a restorative effort to transform<br> the past of the market into a "beacon of remembrance and healing."
    </p>
    <p>
        The effort is to transform the market and the wells into a top class cultural and tourist destination. Doing so would serve as a learning experience <br>to build a more inclusive and equitable society. As stated by the Minister of Tourism, Arts, and Culture, the refurbishment of the Salage Slave <br>market and Wells seeks to "drum home the sacrifices made by ancestors during their enslavement and their unwavering struggle for freedom." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaga_Slave_Market">Reference</a>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;padding: 10px;">Below images is about me <span style="color: gold;"> having a wonderful experiences </span> in salaga museum  </h1>
    <p>During my visit to the Salaga Slave Market, I had a profound and enlightening experience. The on-site museum provided a comprehensive <br>understanding of the market's history, offering a poignant glimpse into the transatlantic slave trade.<p>

        <p>The museum's walls feature an impressive collection of paintings that vividly depict the realities of slavery. These artworks illustrate the diverse <br>groups of people who were enslaved, their oppressors, and the tools used to subjugate them. Notably, the exhibits also highlight the exceptional<br> talents and skills of enslaved individuals.<p>
        
        <p>A knowledgeable director is available to guide visitors through the museum, providing a detailed and engaging interpretation of the artworks.<br>Through their narratives, the director brings the history to life, making the experience feel eerily contemporary.<p>
        
        <p>Overall, my visit to the Salaga Slave Market and museum was a moving and educational experience, offering valuable insights into a painful yet <br>significant chapter in human history. <p>
