        When it comes to the northern parts of Ghana, the cultural dynamics take on a whole new dimension. Compared to the south, the environment is different, the languages are different and the lifestyles are definitely different.
However, the values are still very much Ghanaian. The people are warm and friendly. There is respect for royalty and the elderly. And visitors are warmly received.
The Regional office of the Centre for National Culture in Tamale is located at the Central Business District of the Metropolis. It is a magnificent edifice bounded on the East by the Police Park, to the North by the Police Barracks, to the South by the Regional Library and to the West by Giddipas restaurant on the Tamale-Bolga road.
This was shortly after NAFAC had been held in Bolgatanga to open the beauty of the North to the rest of the world. It was a whole new wo of new fascinations for me.
Fortunately, the likes of #Mr. James A. Adabugah, who hails from the Upper East Region but who later became the Regional Director of the centre explained northern culture to me.
What attracts you immediately is the range of artistry all around you. At the Centre, for instance, there is a rich crafts village with lots of varied craft works in leather, horse shoes, beads, smocks, batik and tie and dye. Also to be seen are sewing centres and watching the process in itself is interesting. <br>



There are also drinking bars and restaurant for Tourists or visitors, who throng in daily for craft works and entertainment at the centre. Because of the centrality of Tamale visitors who are on their way to or from Bolgatanga and beyond do stop by to shop or sight-see. This drives in great human traffic for tourism business.
The broad aim of the Centre is to be achieved through programmes that are aimed at passing down the rich and positive Cultural heritage of the Northern Region from generation to generation.
